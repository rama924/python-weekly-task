# 4)Create a string, an integer, and a floating point number. 
# The string should be named mystring and should contain the word "hello". 
#The floating point number should be named myfloat and should contain the number 10.0, and the integer should be named myint and should contain the number 20.

# 14)prints the characters of string from 3 to 7 skipping one character.
gopi = "World is great!"
print(gopi[3:7])


# In[64]:

# 15)what is the output of print "Hello World"[::-1] and why?
# :: will repeat the slicing in python & [::-1] returns the reverse of the string.
print("Hello world!"[::-1])
